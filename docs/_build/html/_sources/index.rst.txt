Swift_T_Variant_Calling's documentation!
===================================================

This documentation leads you through the Swift/T based variant calling workflow, in terms of what it does, and how to up and running in using it.

This documentation is for a complete Variant Calling pipeline written in Swift/T language. The pipeline has been implemented according to the `GATK's best practices <https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/>`__ for germline variant calling in Whole Genome and Whole Exome Next Generation Sequencing datasets, given a single sample or a cohort of samples.
