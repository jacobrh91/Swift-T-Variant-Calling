Swift_T_Variant_Calling's documentation!
===================================================

Welcome to this documentation for a complete Variant Calling pipeline written in `Swift/T <https://github.com/swift-lang/swift-t>`. This guide leads you through the workflow in terms of what it does, and how to up and running in using it.

The pipeline has been implemented according to the `GATK's best practices <https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/>`__ for germline variant calling in Whole Genome and Whole Exome Next Generation Sequencing datasets, given a single sample or a cohort of samples, paired- or single-end reads with flexibility in choosing analysis stages, software tools and their versions, and their individual parameters for the specific analysis scenario.
