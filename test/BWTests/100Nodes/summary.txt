I actually reserved 110 nodes when performing this testing, as one of the variables I experimented with when testing was the number of ADLB_SERVERS (the things that manage where Swift/T tasks are run)

Things tested:

For a long time, things were failing during this test due to a user error: the file that contains sample information had some duplicate entries. This caused some files to be written correctly, then immediately rewritten, which caused collisions with downstream programs.

The following list of things tested were completed after this user error was corrected (all duplicates were removed)

--------------- 

2 programs per node with 20 ADLB Servers with Picard's MarkDuplicates - FAILED
1 program per node with 20 ADLB Servers with Samblaster to MarkDuplicates - FAILED
   Log: Failed_samblaster.log
1 program per node with 20 ADLB Servers with Picard's MarkDuplicates - FAILED
1 program per node with 20 ADLB Servers with Novosort to mark duplicates - SUCCESSFUL
   Log: successful_run.log
