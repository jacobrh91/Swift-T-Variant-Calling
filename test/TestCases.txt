Tools to test (Not necessary to test all combinations of these, just have at least one run that uses them at some stage)
-------------
1. BWA
2. Novoalign
3a. Novosort (Sorting only; done on every run)
3b. Novosort (Sorting and marking duplicates)
4. Samblaster
5. Picard
6. GATK
7. samtools (Used during every run)

Functionalities
----------------
8. ANALYSIS type
    8a. ALIGN_ONLY
    8b. VC_REALIGN
    8c. VC_NO_REALIGN

9. Splitting by chromosome (SPLIT=Y; CHRNAMES)
10. Not Splitting by chromosome (SPLIT=N)

11. Exit on error
    This can be tested by analyzing two samples and setting the mark duplicates cutoff so that only one of them will fail.
    If this flag is working correctly, it will stop the workflow when set to Y, and will keep going with the sample that passed with N.
    
12. Stop if no samples passed QC
    This can be tested by setting the cutoffs to impossible levels that no sample could pass (i.e. MAP_CUTOFF=101)
    If this functionality is working, this should cause the workflow to stop with a message to the log file stating that
    there were no samples left to test

13. Paired-end reads
14. Single-end reads

15. Test that PROCPERNODE=2 actually runs two jobs on a node simultaneously
16. Novosort memlimit works with at least 2 PROCSPERNODE

17. Jump in at:
    17a. Chromosome Splitting
    17b. Realign, Recal, and Variant Calling
    17c. Combine Chromosomes
    17d. Joint Genotyping

18. Test Timing.log is outputed correctly
