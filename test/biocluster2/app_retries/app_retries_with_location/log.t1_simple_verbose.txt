ADLB: ADLB_Abort(1) calling MPI_Abort(1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 10 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD
with errorcode 1.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.
