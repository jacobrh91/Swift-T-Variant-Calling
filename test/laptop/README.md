The tests in this folder were done on a laptop, with the objective of programming for hardware fault tolerance in Swift-t

Testing files are: `t1_simple.swift`, a script with a `true`, `false` and `echo` app. The other file, `t2_align.swift` is a real bioinformatics task to see how tasks are assigned to different ranks.


The file `t1_simple.log` is the log report of running `t1_simple` with hardware fault tolerance.

Logging shown here is a bit extensive, just to make sure things are actually working properly. 

The `*.tic` files are the compiled stc files, which guided code modifications in Swift-t source
