Update Readme explaining how Quality Control is handled:
  They are handled with assertion functions that stop a process if it is not working
  In practice, if the bam file produced from a particular step of the output contains
  no alignments, the error message suggests that that was the step that failed, and the
  error message is piped to stdout.

Determine how mail should work:
  Even if an error occurs with one sample, Swift/T is supposed to keep going with the
  other processes until it no longer can due to dependency conflicts. So, I think an email
  should only be sent once the program can do no more, at which time, all of the errors 
  should be gathered and presented to the user.
